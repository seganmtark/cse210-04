Greed is a game in which the player seeks to gather as many falling gems as possible. The game continues as long as the player wants more!

## Getting Started

Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and Raylib Python CFFI 3.7 installed and running on your machine. You can install Raylib Python CFFI by opening a terminal and running the following command.

After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.```
